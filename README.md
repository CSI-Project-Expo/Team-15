# 🏆 SentinAI

### *Edge-Based, Tamper-Resistant Smart Surveillance System*

> **Built for CSI Core Projects Initiative 2026**
> **Domain:** Cybersecurity + AI + Full Stack
> **Duration:** 25 Days | **Team Size:** 4

---

**SentinAI converts passive CCTV cameras into active, tamper-resistant safety systems that detect threats in real time and raise alerts even during network or camera attacks.**

---

## ❗ Problem We Address

* Traditional CCTV systems **only record incidents**; they don’t prevent them.
* Many cameras are **easily disabled** via:

  * Feed looping
  * Black screen attacks
  * Network cable cuts
* This leads to **delayed response**, lost evidence, and unsafe environments.

Cities today have thousands of cameras that **witness tragedies but do nothing to stop them**.

---

## 💡 Our Solution (What We Built)

**SentinAI** is an **edge-based smart surveillance system** that:

* Detects **fire, accidents, and SOS gestures** using AI
* Detects **camera tampering and feed manipulation**
* Triggers **local alarms instantly**, even if the internet is cut
* Displays alerts and logs on a **simple live dashboard**

> The system works **independently of the network**, making it reliable in real-world attack scenarios.

---

## 🔐 Why This Is a Cybersecurity Project 

SentinAI focuses on **securing surveillance infrastructure**, not just AI detection.

It ensures:

* **Availability** → Works even during network failure
* **Integrity** → Detects feed manipulation and looping
* **Resilience** → Edge-based processing prevents single-point failure

This places the project under **Cyber-Physical Security & Surveillance Security**, a modern cybersecurity domain.

## ⚙️ Core Features (MVP – Fully Implemented)

### 🧠 AI Detection

* Fire & accident detection (YOLO – pre-trained)
* SOS / distress gesture detection (MediaPipe)

### 🛡️ Security & Tamper Detection

* Black screen detection
* Looped / frozen feed detection
* Camera heartbeat monitoring

### 🚨 Alert System

* Local buzzer / siren (works without internet)
* Dashboard alerts
* Time-stamped incident logging

### 🖥️ Dashboard

* Live camera feed
* Real-time alerts
* Event history log

---

## 🔄 System Workflow (Simple)

1. Camera captures live video
2. Edge device processes feed locally
3. AI detects anomalies (fire / accident / SOS)
4. Security module checks feed integrity
5. Alerts triggered instantly
6. Events logged and shown on dashboard

## ⏳ Execution Timeline (25 Days)

* **Week 1:** Setup & planning
* **Week 2:** AI model integration
* **Week 3:** Security & tamper detection
* **Week 4:** Dashboard & alerts
* **Week 5:** Testing, attack simulation, demo prep

Focus was on **working software**, not slides.

## 🎯 What Makes This Project Stand Out

✔ Real-world problem with social impact
✔ Strong cybersecurity alignment
✔ Edge-based (not cloud-dependent)
✔ Live demo-ready
✔ Clear execution within 25 days

---

## 🚀 Outcome & Impact

SentinAI shows how **AI + Cybersecurity** can:

* Prevent incidents instead of just recording them
* Protect surveillance systems from attacks
* Improve emergency response during the critical **Golden Hour**
